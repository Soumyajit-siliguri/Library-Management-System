# 📚 Library Management System (Java - Console Based)
A simple console-based Library Management System built in Java using `switch` statements and fundamental OOP principles.
This beginner-friendly project helps you learn how to manage menu-driven programs, use classes and objects, and simulate real-world systems like a library.

## 🚀 Project Purpose
This project is designed as a stepping stone for Java learners. It will help you:
* Understand how to build menu-driven applications using `switch` statements.
* Learn to model real-world entities using Java classes and objects.
* Implement core functionalities like searching, adding, and updating data.

    🔧 **Note**: This version uses basic Java concepts. As my skills grow, I will modularize the codebase and introduce advanced features (layers like DAO, Service, etc.).

## 🎯 Features
The system currently supports the following operations:
1. ➖ Exit Application
2. ➕ Add a New Book
3. 📈 Upgrade Quantity of a Book
4. 🔍 Search for a Book
5. 📚 Show All Books
6. 🧑‍🎓 Register Student
7. 🧾 Show All Registered Students
8. 📤 Check Out Book (Issue to Student)
9. 📥 Check-In Book (Return from Student)

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
* `switch-case` statements for menu handling
* Java classes and objects
* ArrayLists for dynamic data storage
* Basic input handling using Scanner
* Encapsulation and simple class design

## 🌱 Future Enhancements (Planned)
* Modular architecture (Service, DAO, Model layers)
* File handling for persistence
* GUI with JavaFX or Swing
* MySQL database integration
* Role-based access (Admin vs Student)
* Search filters and sorting
* Enhanced error handling and input validation

## 📌 Useful For
* Java beginners learning core concepts
* Understanding real-world application modeling
* College mini-projects or console app practice
